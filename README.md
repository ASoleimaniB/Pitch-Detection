# Pitch-Detection
This GUI by using a trained neural network recognize musical pitch 
Musical pitch determined by the first peak in the frequency domain, for many instruments the first peak is the highest peak but for Violin, Cello, Kamancheh and so on it is not true. In these instrument other peaks can have higher values. So by a comprehensive and intelligent method I managed to recognize them simply

to run, type in command window: pitch 
(don't run the GUI file)
